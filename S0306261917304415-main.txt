With the privatization and intense competition that characterize the volatile energy sector, the gas tur-
bine industry currently faces new challenges of increasing operational Ô¨Çexibility, reducing operating
costs, improving reliability and availability while mitigating the environmental impact. In this complex,
changing sector, the gas turbine community could address a set of these challenges by further develop-
ment of high Ô¨Ådelity, more accurate and computationally efÔ¨Åcient engine health assessment, diagnostic
and prognostic systems. Recent studies have shown that engine gas-path performance monitoring still
remains the cornerstone for making informed decisions in operation and maintenance of gas turbines.
This paper offers a systematic review of recently developed engine performance monitoring, diagnostic
and prognostic techniques. The inception of performance monitoring and its evolution over time, tech-
niques used to establish a high-quality dataset using engine model performance adaptation, and effects
of computationally intelligent techniques on promoting the implementation of engine fault diagnosis are
reviewed. Moreover, recent developments in prognostics techniques designed to enhance the mainte-
nance decision-making scheme and main causes of gas turbine performance deterioration are discussed
to facilitate the fault identiÔ¨Åcation module. The article aims to organize, evaluate and identify patterns
and trends in the literature as well as recognize research gaps and recommend new research areas in
the Ô¨Åeld of gas turbine performance-based monitoring. The presented insightful concepts provide
experts, students or novice researchers and decision-makers working in the area of gas turbine engines
with the state of the art for performance-based condition monitoring.

1. Introduction

The gas turbine is one of the main sources of power for many
applications such as civil and military aircraft, naval and commer-
cial ships, electricity production, gas compression, and high-scale
pumping services. The deep penetration of renewables into the
energy mix has ampliÔ¨Åed the need for gas turbines to operate more
efÔ¨Åciently and in partnership with renewable energy sources such
that energy is produced in an environmentally friendly manner. In
addition, for many of the world‚Äôs largest manufacturers, aftermar-
ket service and parts operations are essential to their business. For
example, Rolls-Royce has more than 14,000 aerospace engines in
service, operated by more than 500 airlines and powering more
than 5.5 million commercial Ô¨Çights per year and the company‚Äôs
service and part business revenue is about 55% of the approxi-
mately US$11 billion total revenues [1]. Within this context, sev-
eral technical challenges with respect to the operation and
lifecycle cost of gas turbines must be addressed to efÔ¨Åciently
implement this technology in a volatile energy market. It is well
known that the development and implementation of a robust, efÔ¨Å-
cient and Ô¨Çexible maintenance strategy signiÔ¨Åcantly improves the
reliability and availability of gas turbine assets and, as a result,
decreases the number of unpredicted breakdowns, operating costs,

and downtime. The main factors affecting gas turbine maintenance
planning are shown in Fig. 1. It is clear from Fig. 1 that there are
numerous trade-offs among environmental, technological, eco-
nomic and operational factors that establish a successful mainte-
nance and operational strategy of gas turbine assets [2].

In recent years, the gas turbine manufacturers have trans-
formed into modern digital businesses by converging the industrial
equipment, data and the internet into a platform that enables the
optimization of asset monitoring and management [3]. Examples
of such technologies are GE‚Äôs Predix and Digital Twin where in
the case of gas turbines numerous Ô¨Çeets of engines across the globe
are simulated, monitored and analyzed as seen from Fig. 2.

The analytics methods, which are based on banks of data con-
taining the operational and simulation history of the engines, are
employed for improving the gas turbine operators understanding
for these complex nonlinear machines. Therefore, the maintenance
actions are based on informed judgments for the assets in order to
maximize their proÔ¨Åtability, reduce life cycle costs and improve
reliability and availability. It has been recently demonstrated that
the implementation of such digital platform for analytics and
optimization can have signiÔ¨Åcant savings in the Oil & Gas and
the Airline sectors to name a few. For instance, in the airline sector,
both Southwest [4] and Quantas [5] airlines are in the process of

saving millions of dollars in fuel cost by a data-crunching partner-
ship with the engine manufacturers. On the other hand in the O&G
sector [6], the savings attributed by implementing this digital plat-
form is in the order of billions per year taking into account that an
unscheduled downtime for an LNG facility and an offshore plat-
form cost $25 million and $7 million per day, respectively. The
opportunity for developing and adopting such a digital platform
based on engine models, condition monitoring, diagnostics and
prognostics solutions is spearheading the transformation of the
conventional industrial environment into its digital era with huge
prospects for the availability and reliability of equipment.

It is generally accepted [2,7‚Äì9] that condition-based mainte-
nance (CBM) is an effective method for enhancing the machinery
maintenance strategy and shifting from classical ‚Äò‚Äòfail and Ô¨Åx‚Äô‚Äô prac-
tices to a ‚Äò‚Äòpredict and prevent‚Äô‚Äô methodology. As summarized in
Table 1, while reactive-based corrective maintenance is performed
just upon failure or error happening in the system, preventive
maintenance employs the statistical machine information and
operational experience to schedule successive overhauls in order
to prevent unexpected failure in the system. However, to improve
the reliability and availability of the system, in predictive mainte-
nance, the operating conditions of the equipment are continuously
monitored to detect the need for real-time maintenance. Conse-
quently, the continuous development and implementation of con-
dition monitoring, diagnostic and prognostics methods can
signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce both the economic losses caused by system
breakdown and the costs attributed to unnecessary repair and
replacement of components.

Generally, the informed judgment that supports any mainte-
nance decision is the objective of the CBM, the success of which
relies on two related processes described as follows:

(A) Diagnostics is the process of determining the health status
and the equipment deterioration using information deliv-
ered by the condition-monitoring system [11]. The main
objectives of diagnostics are: (i) fault detection, which indi-
cates that an undesirable event is imminent; (ii) fault isola-
tion, which locates the faulty component; and (iii) fault
identiÔ¨Åcation, which aids in determining the root cause of
the fault.

(B) Prognostics is the ability to forecast the evolution of engine
deterioration [12]. The two major objectives of prognostics
are: (i) forecasting the impending failures and (ii) estimating
the remaining useful life of the engine.

As discussed by Puggina et al. [13], the implementation of
proper diagnostic and prognostic approaches has several merits
mainly including tuning components costs and performing predic-
tive maintenance actions, optimizing shop visits and providing
spare parts for efÔ¨Åcient maintenance management, and optimizing
gas turbine operating condition. Brasco et al. [14] also explain that
these models allow to make estimates on the relative lifetimes of
engines under different conditions and subsequently the informa-
tion can be used in Ô¨Ånancial considerations for producers and
consumers.

A big family of research studies has been performed in the area
of diagnostics and prognostics, which ampliÔ¨Åes the importance of
performance-based monitoring in gas turbine health management.
Many advances and developments in the theory, application, and
implementation of these tools have been recently presented in
journals, technical reports, and conference proceedings. Moreover,
the need of condition monitoring, diagnostic and prognostic tools
is greater now, more than ever before, given that the gas turbines

are operating under transient conditions which include fast start
up and shut downs to compensate for the intermittent nature of
renewables. Under such operating conditions the gas turbines are
consuming their useful life faster than a base load gas turbine.
Within this context, a new group of research works dealing with
the challenging aspect of performing diagnostic and prognostics
under these conditions has emerged towards improved condition
based maintenance. In contrary to the excellent existing reviews
of gas turbine diagnostics by Li [15], Marinai et al. [16], and Vol-
poni [17], this review aims to highlight the recent trend for per-
forming diagnostics and prognostics with transient data. For
transient engine operating conditions, the condition monitoring
systems should capture the fast nonlinear dynamics of the engine
at an increased frequency in order to establish a good quality data
set for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Under this scheme the
most challenging aspect of gas turbine diagnostics is the fact that
the engineers/data scientists have to extract, correct, Ô¨Ålter and
smooth the vast amount of gas path measurements from ‚Äò‚Äòdata
lakes‚Äô in order to establish a high-quality data set for diagnostics
and subsequently prognostics. The importance of performing diag-
nostics under transient conditions is ampliÔ¨Åed by the fact that
prognostic methods are heavily relying on the engine operating
and ambient conditions. The reduction of the downtime and
improvement in the availability and reliability of dynamic operat-
ing gas turbines has transformed the Ô¨Åeld of diagnostic and prog-
nostics into a challenging arena for scholars of diverse disciplines
to propose numerous diagnostic and prognostic solutions. Given
the plethora of papers in the Ô¨Åeld, this review article aims to pro-
vide insights about where the current research is heading and
those issues that attract signiÔ¨Åcant research and development in
the short and long term. To achieve this goal, the state of the art
of performance-based health monitoring technologies and applica-
tions for gas turbine power integration support are reviewed from
different aspects. The frameworks used in a comprehensive gas
turbine performance-based health management system, beginning
with data collection and extending to advisory generation for deci-
sion support are presented. The article aims to organize, evaluate
and identify patterns and trends in the literature as well as recog-
nize research gaps and recommend new research areas in the Ô¨Åeld
of gas turbine monitoring. This study brings together several con-
cepts of gas turbine monitoring in an insightful way that has not
been done before.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces the various types of gas turbine monitoring techniques.
Section 3 describes the principles and the basic concept of gas tur-

bine performance-based condition monitoring. Advances in engine
performance simulation and adaptation are summarized in Sec-
tion 4, followed by sections on recent research in gas turbine
performance-based fault detection and isolation (Sections 5), fault
identiÔ¨Åcation (Section 6) and engine deterioration prognostics
(Section 7). Finally, Section 8 offers concluding remarks together
with research directions needed for the next generation of engine
diagnostics and prognostics schemes.

2. Gas turbine condition monitoring

Typical maintenance contracts are progressively altered to
reÔ¨Çect the bilateral interest among manufacturers and operators
that demand the best deals in terms of operation and maintenance.
Moreover, a signiÔ¨Åcant trend has emerged in which the gas turbine
operators demand from the manufacturers a guaranteed degrada-
tion rate and lifecycle cost depending on the use of the equipment.
In gas turbine applications, a wide range of requirements set by the
operators should be met by the manufacturers in global and long-
term service contracts. The main objective is to reach effective
responses to these requirements through the development of
advanced tools for precise condition-based maintenance via condi-
tion monitoring. Generally, gas turbine condition monitoring can
be implemented using different methods and technologies of dif-
ferent Ô¨Ådelity, each with its own advantages (Fig. 3) [18].

The causes of gas turbine deterioration fall into two categories.
The Ô¨Årst cause is of a mechanical nature where the phenomena are
not aerodynamically coupled such as misalignment, unbalance,
loose components, bearing defects, and lack of lubrication. As
shown in Fig. 3, many techniques such as vibration, oil and wear
debris analysis, acoustics, thermography, lubrication Ô¨Çow parame-
ters, load analysis, and metal temperature (which are considered
non-performance-based methods) can be used to assess this dete-
rioration. The second cause is aerodynamic or performance related
problems such as fouling and debris deposit in axial compressors,
erosion, and corrosion of the blades, improper combustion. In the
case of this kind of deterioration, performance-based health mon-
itoring, also known as gas path analysis (GPA), is a cost-efÔ¨Åcient
approach to delivering early warning information on ongoing or
impending failures.
It should be noted that as discussed by
Mehr-Homhi et al. [19] several problems that manifest themselves
as the mechanical error may, in fact, have underlying causes that
are aerodynamic (or performance) related in nature and can be cat-
egorized as aeromechanical i.e. mechanically and aerodynamically

also emphasizes the need for implementation of performance-
based health monitoring in gas turbine maintenance since it cre-
ates faster and more reliable information for gas turbine users
who reÔ¨Åne the maintenance strategy accordingly. Therefore, this
study mainly focuses on review and summarizing outstanding
efforts that are conducted on gas turbine fault detection and prog-
nostics using gas path faults and performance deterioration. How-
ever, a family of scholarly works employs non-performance-based
methods for gas turbine monitoring. Table 2 presents a list of
recent most important such research efforts.

As shown in Fig. 3, gas turbine monitoring system can be gener-
ally categorized as on-line and off-line monitoring. On-line moni-
toring systems in industrial gas turbines is a common practice
nowadays [30,31] which offers the mean to continuously monitor
the performance of the engine over its lifetime and can be used
in engine fault diagnostics, prognostics and control purposes in
real time. This philosophy has also started to be adopted in the case
of aero engines. For example, Rolls Royce uses Engine Health Man-
agement (EHM) to track the health of the engine, using onboard
sensors and live satellite feeds. Although many recent research
efforts have driven great improvement in this area, the high costs
and inaccuracy due to monitoring of data characterized by noise
are the main limitations of these methods. However, in off-line
or off-board monitoring, the essential data are acquired using an
embedded device and are transmitted to the analysis server or
ground station for further data analysis in the future. Off-line mon-
itoring is not as costly as on-line methods and yields accurate
results by implementing the appropriate data processing tech-
niques. However, the increased risk of using off-line monitoring
and consequently missing certain failure events that occur
between successive data acquisitions should be noted.

parameters, it is possible to identify faulty components [33]. The
theory underlying this concept is summarized in Fig. 4.

*

The most crucial component degradations are those that occur
in compressors and turbines because these components are the
most important and expensive components in gas turbine engines.
Combustion chamber degradation is not likely to be the direct
cause of performance deterioration and therefore cannot be
detected by gas path analysis [35]. The degradation might be rep-
resented by the deviation of component health parameters, inde-
pendent variable (D x
), and measurements, dependent variable
(D z

*
).
Several limitations in the application of performance monitor-
ing make the performance-based diagnostic and prognostic prob-
lem a challenging one. First, to perform a health assessment,
diagnostics and prognostics in a comprehensive condition-based
maintenance program, in-depth knowledge of the engine perfor-
mance and a complete set of operating measurements are neces-
sary. In addition, careful estimates are required to select the
appropriate type and number of measurements and the corre-
sponding sensor locations. Improper selection might lead to non-
convergence of the solution process [36]. Measured data combined
with sensor noise and bias is the third challenging issue. The sensor
measurements are often distorted by noise and bias, thereby mask-
ing the true condition of the engine and leading to incorrect esti-
mation result [37]. Finally, the combined effect of system non-
linearity and sensor selection might result in multiple health
degradation scenarios that produce similar measurement shifts.
This is a difÔ¨Åcult problem to deal with because of estimation tech-
niques, in general, give only one set of estimated health parameters
for a given set of measurements without the capability to indicate
the level of conÔ¨Ådence in the results.

4. Engine model performance adaptation

3. Principles of gas turbine performance-based monitoring

The most popular performance-based concept for assessing the
behavior of a gas turbine is gas path analysis (GPA), which is brieÔ¨Çy
described as follows.

Physical faults yield to deviations in one or more of the engine
health variables or independent parameters, such as component
Ô¨Çow capacity and efÔ¨Åciency. These factors in turn cause deviations
in the measured variables or dependent parameters, such as pres-
sure and temperature, fuel Ô¨Çow rate and rotational speeds [32].
Component health parameters are not directly measurable, such
as mass Ô¨Çow functions and component efÔ¨Åciencies, but they are
thermodynamically correlated with the measurable parameters.
As a consequence, gas-path faults have observable effects on the
measurements. With the availability of an essential measurement
set and a model function that relates these data to the health

Before exploring the performance-based diagnostic and prog-
nostic approaches, it is necessary to consider the possible sources
of data and information that could potentially feed the process.
As discussed in detail in subsequent sections, gas performance
diagnostic approaches can be generally categorized into model-
based and data-driven methods. In model-based methods, an ana-
lytical model of the engine must be developed and progressively
updated to match the current status of the engine. Using this pro-
cess, the health parameters can be continuously calculated, and
their deviations from the normal condition can be implemented
for performance-based monitoring.
In data-driven methods,
although the fault detection module can be developed only with
data corresponding to the engine healthy condition, the fault isola-
tion module must be developed for the healthy condition and all
different faulty conditions. Therefore, the required data can be col-
lected in three ways. First from the real engine over its lifetime,

second from experimental tests, and third from an engine model.
The Ô¨Årst and second methods are costly and may require a high
variety of sensors for computing accurately the mass Ô¨Çow and
isentropic efÔ¨Åciency parameters of the engine components [38].
Reduction of the collected data or experimental measurements to
a minimum and collection of the remaining quantities using a
gas turbine model is an affordable way to address this problem.
Although a 0-D model is adequate for performance diagnostic pur-
poses, it is necessary to progressively tune/adapt the model for

improving the accuracy of the diagnostic analysis. Therefore, in
the model-based methods, and even in data-driven methods for
design and testing the accuracy of monitoring systems, access to
an accurate engine model is beneÔ¨Åcial. Although the knowledge
of modeling gas turbines at the design point and in off-design con-
ditions can be found in many references such as [39,40], as indi-
cated by many studies (e.g., Ref. [41,42]), the major drawback in
development of these models is the lack of component maps. These
data are usually proprietary to the gas turbine manufacturers, and

128

only a limited portion of the performance data, in the form of char-
acteristics charts derived from experimental tests or from an
engine performance prediction program referred as the ‚Äò‚Äòengine
deck‚Äù, might be available to the Ô¨Ånal users. In this condition, the
required engine model can be reÔ¨Åned and matched for the engine
under investigation using performance adaptation through compo-
nent characteristic tuning. The implementation of the adaptive
modeling diagnostic method allows for accurate condition assess-
ment during base and part load operation leading to the identiÔ¨Åca-
tion of engine components deterioration and the root cause of an
engine performance shift [30]. As shown in Fig. 5, performance
adaptation uses an optimization algorithm to tune the non-
measurable component parameters (x). Toward this goal, for a
speciÔ¨Åc controller set point (u), which is related to the required
power and rotational speed, and in a speciÔ¨Åc ambient condition,
the model will be optimized in such a manner that the model out-
put measurements (zm) match the collected measurements of the
reference engine (zr). Depending on the control architecture of
the engine, the control parameter u which is also known as ‚Äò‚Äòhan-
dle‚Äù can be fuel Ô¨Çow, power output, turbine entry temperature,
shaft rotational speed or any other quantity that governs the Ô¨Çow
of the system‚Äôs energy.

The overall objective of

the component map modeling
approaches is to obtain mathematical equations that can accu-
rately exhibit the relationship between corrected rotational speed,
corrected Ô¨Çow capacity, pressure ratio, and isentropic efÔ¨Åciency. To
simplify the model using performance maps, it is common to nor-
malize the corrected speed, corrected mass Ô¨Çow, pressure ratio and
isentropic efÔ¨Åciencies using design point values. This work reviews
a family of component map modeling methods aimed at improving
the accuracy of gas turbine performance simulation for diagnosis
and prognosis.

Scaling is one of the most common methodologies used in the
process of component map representation [44‚Äì47]. In this method,
all of the values of the original curve are multiplied by a speciÔ¨Åc
factor to obtain the component characteristics of a similar engine.
The conventional form of this method uses a constant scaling fac-
tor in such a manner that the design point of the targeted engine
becomes the same as the design point of the reference engine.
However, due to two major problems, use of this method in appli-
cations that require higher accuracy presents two main limitations.
First, the selected reference gas turbine should be highly similar to
the target engine. Second, the exact design points of both the ref-
erence and target gas turbines must be known. A modiÔ¨Åed version
of the scaling method is presented by Kong, Ki et al. [45] in which
the experimentally collected performance data at certain off-
design points are used in a performance adaptation model to pro-
mote the scaling factors with the aim of achieving better-scaled
maps. Li et al. [46,47] also applied genetic algorithms to search
for an optimal set of linear and nonlinear scaling factor functions
in a performance adaptation scheme.

Stage stacking is the procedure used to obtain the overall mul-
tistage compressor and turbine maps using generalized stage per-
formance curves. This technique permits an in-depth stage-by-
stage analysis of the Ô¨Çow through the compressor and turbine. This
method is primarily used to tune the compressor map through
stage-by-stage analysis. The general theory and the preliminary
successful implementation of this method can be found in the
works done by Muir et al. [48] and Howell and Bonham [49]. A
recent development of this technique could be found in the work
done by Spina [50]. In this study, the author introduced a tech-
nique during which the unknown parameters specifying the gener-
alized stage performance are determined by combining a Cycle
Program with the compressor and turbine performance maps
obtained using the stage-stacking procedure. This is performed
by seeking the values of the unknown parameters that better adapt

to overall performance and thermodynamic measurements col-
lected on a gas turbine. Muir et al. [48] applied this methodology
for compressor map tuning and demonstrated that it is appropriate
for predicting the performance of elements that incorporate vari-
able stators. In another effort, Mirza-Baig and Saravanamuttoo
[51] approximate the mass Ô¨Çow characteristics of multistage tur-
bines by nozzle characteristics. Lee and Kim [52] also employed
the stage-stacking method for the compressor, and a stage-by-
stage method considering blade cooling for the turbine to perform
an off-design performance simulation. The result of this study
showed that the component model obtained using this model are
quite reliable for performance simulation.

In another group of component map representation methods
known as Regression-based map Ô¨Åtting, an assumed mathematical
model for the characteristic curves is tuned through performance
adaptation and represents another effective technique. Kong and
Ki [53] used this technique by applying three order polynomial
equations to Ô¨Ånd the corrected compressor Ô¨Çow rates and efÔ¨Å-
ciency curves as a function of pressure ratio and corrected speed.
In this work, an error minimization genetic algorithm is used to
Ô¨Ånd the regression coefÔ¨Åcients in the process of performance adap-
tation. With the objective of higher prediction accuracy for engine
performance, Tsoutsanis et al. [41,42] established a new compres-
sor map generation model using a novel regression technique,
which assumes that at the constant corrected speed lines, the pres-
sure ratio is an elliptic function of the corrected mass Ô¨Çow rate and
the efÔ¨Åciency is a third-order polynomial curve of the corrected
mass Ô¨Çow rate. Those researchers took advantage of genetic algo-
rithms to determine the coefÔ¨Åcients of the elliptical functions
and polynomials. In another effort by Tsoutsanis et al. [54,55], a
set of polynomial equations for turbine pressure ratio versus Ô¨Çow
capacity curves and a set of trigonometric functions were used to
represent the isentropic efÔ¨Åciency versus corrected mass Ô¨Çow rate
curves. These studies used Matlab‚Äôs built-in nonlinear uncon-
strained optimization algorithm known as ‚Äò‚Äòfminsearch‚Äù in the per-
formance adaptation process.

Table 3 presents the main features of these three techniques
that are used to represent the gas turbine component characteristic
maps.

All three introduced methods require an optimization process
to Ô¨Ånalize the component map tuning. In fact, in a particular model
that simulates compressor and turbine characteristics, adaptation
can aid in Ô¨Ånding the optimal scaling factors, the rating parameters
of the stage, and the regression model coefÔ¨Åcients.

In addition to the above groups of component map modeling
techniques that have been successfully integrated into engine
models and tested for diagnostic purposes, it is worth mentioning
a group of studies that examined the representation of the com-
pressor map alone. In principle, the compressor map is the most

challenging and crucial performance characteristic of an engine
model, and this importance has led to the development of several
methods for representing the compressor map characteristics. The
majority of these studies used artiÔ¨Åcial neural networks [58‚Äì60]
and fuzzy expert systems [61] to represent the shape and predict
the operating points within the modeled curves of the compressor
performance maps. Maps can also be determined by Ô¨Çow analysis
schemes such as the stream line curvature (SLC) methodology [62]
or high-Ô¨Ådelity computational Ô¨Çuid dynamics approaches (CFD)
[63] if the geometry of the mechanical device is accessible.

A variety of models and software tools have been developed for
both off-line and real-time performance adaptation of gas turbines
with different levels of complexity, Ô¨Ådelity, accuracy and computer
performance requirements. In the Aerospace Department of Delft
Technical University, a software package known as GSP (a gas tur-
bine simulation program) [64] was developed and is capable of
simulating almost all types of gas turbines (turboshaft, turboprop,
turbofan, single and multi-shafts, etc.). Another software product
known as GASTURB, developed by Kurzke [65], is updated to ver-
sion 12.0 and is extensively used as a gas turbine performance sim-
ulator. GASTURB is able to simulate most of the normal engine
types, including mixed and unmixed turbofans with or without
boosters, turboshafts with or without heat exchangers, and one-
shaft or two-shaft turboprop engines. US engine manufacturers
and research institutes,
including NASA, have collaboratively
developed NPSS [66,67] (Numerical Propulsion System Simulation)
which is a powerful gas turbine simulation tool with several
advanced capabilities. In another effort, an interactive gas turbine
simulation and modeling environment called ‚Äò‚ÄòPROOSIS‚Äù [68]
(PRopulsion Object Oriented SImulation Software) has been devel-
oped as part of the ‚Äò‚ÄòVIVACE-ECP‚Äù (Value Improvement through a
Virtual Aeronautical Collaborative Enterprise - European Cycle Pro-
gramme) project to be used by European industries. Since the mid-
1990s, SIMULINK and many other GUI (graphical user interface)
programs have been developed using MATLAB [69‚Äì71].

5. Fault detection and isolation (FDI) approaches

Over the last two decades, signiÔ¨Åcant research efforts have
focused on the development of performance-based fault detection

and isolation for gas turbines. In the fundamental sense, FDI
involves continuous processing of engine performance measure-
ments in regard to controller set point (u√û and ambient condition
to track the deviations of selected engine health parameters (zr)
from their corresponding values at the clean/healthy condition
(zm). The main procedure of this method is illustrated in Fig. 6.

The chosen parameters and the analysis method characterize
each different diagnostic method. Generally, three different cate-
gories of performance monitoring approaches are used in the
condition-based maintenance of gas turbines. The Ô¨Årst category
includes model-based methods, which involve analytical modeling
of gas turbine operation and are quite promising for real-time con-
dition monitoring. Model-based approaches have proven their
ability to detect both abrupt and more notably, gradual degrada-
tion in engine performance in real-time online implementations.
However, as the modeling uncertainties and system complexity
increase, the monitoring accuracy decreases [72]. The second
group refers to data-based models such as neural networks sys-
tems that ‚Äòlearn‚Äô from examination of real data containing nominal
and known faulty conditions. Research results have shown that
these methods offer a Ô¨Çexible tool for addressing the complex
and non-linear characteristics of dynamic systems. The last group
includes systems that embody ‚Äòrules of thumb‚Äô that have been
developed and reÔ¨Åned by human maintenance experts. Examples
of these systems are rule-based expert systems and fuzzy logic
approaches. Although these methods are capable of offering expla-
nations and methods that reach a particular solution, it is highly
complex to Ô¨Ånd a proper set of rules, functions, and tuning that
can obtain a satisfactory solution as the system complexity
increases. These two latter groups of approaches, which are also
known as data-driven techniques, heavily rely on real-time or col-
lected historical data from engine sensors and do not directly
require a detailed mathematical model of the system.

Gas turbine performance diagnostic approaches can be gener-
ally categorized as linear or non-linear methods. Kamboukos and
Mathioudakis [73] compared these two methods theoretically
and presented an overall assessment of their merits and weak-
nesses with the conclusion that the use of linear methods might
lead to substantial inaccuracies in estimation of degradation. The
inadequacy of the linearity assumption has led to the development

of non-linear alternatives. Although all data-driven approaches are
non-linear, model-based methods involve both linear and non-
linear methods. With the plethora of techniques available to mon-
itor the health of equipment, the question always arises as to the
optimal technique for interpreting the condition of the engine.
The following subsections offer a summary of key approaches
applied for this purpose.

this assumption, the Ô¨Årst gas path analysis method was introduced
by Urban [74], which is now referred to as linear GPA using inÔ¨Çu-
ence coefÔ¨Åcient matrix (ICM) inversion. The original concept of this

diagnostic technique relies on using the inverted ICM, H
known as the fault coefÔ¨Åcient matrix (FCM). FCM assists in obtain-
ing deviations in the engine component health parameter (D x

examining the deviations in the gas path measurements (D z
).

Linear GPA with ICM inversion has been applied widely to gas
path analysis of engines. A valuable overview of this method is
given by Smetana [75]. However, due to the nonlinear thermody-
namic behavior of engine performance, the linear performance
adaptation might not be able to deliver an accurate estimation of
engine performance deviation. To improve the accuracy of this lin-
ear method, Escher and Singh [76] applied a Newton-Raphson-
based iterative method to solve the non-linear relationship
between the engine performance parameters and measurements.
Gas path analysis using ICM inversion is idealistically simple, offers
quick solutions and is capable of performing multiple fault diag-
noses. However, this method is limited to detecting the degrada-
tion at a small scale.
In addition, an inaccurate inÔ¨Çuence
coefÔ¨Åcient matrix, measurement uncertainty, and correlated mea-
surements seriously affect its accuracy. Moreover, using this
method, the number of measurements (m) must be equal or
greater than the number of health parameters (n), (i.e. m P n√û, to
ensure a unique solution of performance adaptation.

The weighted-least-squares technique is used in many engine
gas path analysis systems to increase the diagnostic accuracy in
the case of sensor errors [77,78]. The least square Ô¨Åtting process
uses a parametric model to minimize the sum of weighted squared
deviations between the actual and predicted measurements using
one or more coefÔ¨Åcients that are estimated by the Ô¨Åtting process.
In addition, the measurement uncertainties associated with the
gas path measurements are also considered using a weighting
matrix with their respective sample variances. As described by
Kamunge [79], the modiÔ¨Åed FCM and performance model can be
written as

tion process can be used. As stated by Li and Korakiantis [81], the
non-linear weighted-least-square method is capable of considering
the performance nonlinearities of an advanced non-linear diagnos-
tic approach. Kamunge [79] presented a detailed discussion on the
non-linear weighted least squares method and highlighted the
model capabilities in terms of addressing random measurement
noise and fast computation.

Kalman Ô¨Ålter employs the system‚Äôs dynamics model and
sequential measurements to estimate the state variables of
dynamic systems which are better than the estimate obtained by
using measurement alone. The schematic
representation of
performance-based condition monitoring of gas turbine engine
using Kalman Ô¨Ålter is shown in Fig. 7 [82].

Among the variants of the Kalman Ô¨Ålter techniques, the linear
Kalman Ô¨Ålter (LKF) is the method most commonly used in engine
diagnostics [87,88]. In a signiÔ¨Åcant effort by Kobayashi and Simon,
a bank of LKFs was developed in which each Ô¨Ålter is designed to
detect a speciÔ¨Åc component, sensor, or actuator fault [89]. In this
model, in the case of a particular fault, all Ô¨Ålters except the one
with the correct hypothesis produced large estimation errors,
and thereby the speciÔ¨Åc fault could be isolated. To maintain the
state variable estimates within a user-deÔ¨Åned envelope and ensure
that they vary slowly with time, Simon and Simon [90] effectively
incorporated a linear state inequality into the Kalman Ô¨Åltering
method.

To decrease the estimation errors that are coupled with nonlin-
earities, Simon [91] presented a comparison between LKF and two
nonlinear Kalman Ô¨Ålter-based techniques known as the extended
Kalman Ô¨Ålter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman Ô¨Ålter (UKF) for the
purpose of engine health monitoring. Generally, EKF is the nonlin-
ear version of the Kalman Ô¨Ålter that linearizes about an estimate of
the current mean and covariance. In systems with high non-
linearity, the EKF might result in particularly poor performance.
Therefore, the accuracy of the model might be more signiÔ¨Åcantly
improved using the UKF, which uses deterministic sampling to
form a new mean and covariance estimate. This paper concludes
that the use of an EKF warrants modeling of the engine dynamics
nonlinearity with sufÔ¨Åcient accuracy. Use of UKF is not justiÔ¨Åable
because it imposes a further computational burden without signif-
icant improvement. However, based on the simulation result of a
developed non-linear multiple model KF-based approach, Meskin
et al. [92] proved improvements in the performance of the UKF
over the EKF scheme in terms of fault detection times and func-
tionality and also concluded that the UKF scheme is signiÔ¨Åcantly
more robust to large sensor noise.

Applying LKF to performance monitoring poses selected stabil-
ity problems if few measurements are available [93]. In the case of
negative redundancy, i.e. (m < n√û, a smearing effect is likely to
occur, which causes the fault to spread over multiple parameters
rather than being correctly isolated [94]. Increasing the number
of samples could make the redundancy positive, but because this
might be related to nearly the same operating points, it does not
represent a set of independent observations, and therefore, the
estimation remains unstable. To address the effect of the undeter-
mined problem, a tuning parameter that is a linear subset of the
original health parameter is introduced using an optimal transfor-
mation matrix [95]. In another study, this tuning is extended to
state estimation of the non-linear dynamic system known as unde-
termined EKF [82].

The genetic algorithm (GA) is a heuristic search and optimiza-
tion approach that follows the procedure of natural selection. In
this method, the interacting variables in the problem are Ô¨Årst
mixed and encoded to form a series of binary strings to generate
numerical chromosomes. A random population of chromosomes
is constructed and is subsequently ranked based on a Ô¨Åtness func-
tion to determine its accuracy. The Ô¨Åttest string, the elite, is per-
mitted to survive and reproduce. This process can be conducted
using genetic operators such as crossover and mutation and leads
to the generation of offspring chromosomes and a new higher-
quality population. The continuous cycling character of the genetic
operators could evolve toward the desired solutions [96].

Conventional optimization for the purpose of gas turbine fault
diagnostics was Ô¨Årst introduced by Stamatis et al. in 1990 [97].
The GA algorithm adopted in gas turbine fault isolation is based
on techniques that use sensor-based and model-based informa-
tion. As shown in Fig. 8, the goal is to minimize an objective func-
tion, Eq. (9) [98], that compares the performance measurements of
the actual gas turbine with a set of measurements obtained from
an engine performance model, which is subjected to permutation

from [99].

of implanted faults. The solution of the algorithm is a set of
implanted faults in a simulator in which the corresponding mea-
surement is closest to the actual measurements and can be effec-
tively applied for purposes of fault isolation [99].

Gulati et al. [100] applied the GA-based technique for a poorly
instrumented gas turbine engine (RB199) using the concept of
multiple objective point analysis. Sampath et al. [101] validated
this method for fault diagnosis in advanced cycle engines (ICR
WR21) and reported signiÔ¨Åcant success. Breikin et al. [102] pre-
sented the concept of on-line diagnostics-based GA for gas turbine
engines and highlighted the ability of this technique to detect
notably small component deviations even in the presence of mea-
surement uncertainties. However, the work of Sampath and Singh
[103] comparing GA with other applicable methods for the purpose

5.2. Data driven methods

Recently, great attention has been focused on the development
of data-driven methods, mainly known as
computational
intelligence-based methods, for engine fault detection and isola-
tion. Due to their capabilities in the modeling of nonlinear dynam-
ical
(ANN) have been
extensively exploited and used to achieve fault diagnostics in gas
turbine engines. ANN is a black-box model of a nonlinear, multi-

systems, artiÔ¨Åcial neural networks

variable static and dynamic system and can be treated using input-
output information measured from the system. The most common
ANN includes several layers of plain processing elements known as
neurons, the interconnections among them and the weights allo-
cated to these interconnections. The weights store information
related to the input-output structure of the network. For a more
detailed overview of neural network processing and development,
the reader is referred to [104]. The main concepts of using ANN for
the purpose of fault detection and isolation in gas turbines are
demonstrated in Figs. 9(a) and (b), respectively.

As shown in Fig. 9, to perform fault detection analysis using
ANN, a preliminary phase known as healthy system identiÔ¨Åcation
is necessary. The main goal of this phase is to develop networks
that are able to accurately represent the behavior of a gas turbine
engine in the clean/healthy condition. Subsequently, the outputs of
the actual engine and the trained healthy networks are used to
generate the residuals. If the residual exceeds a predetermined
threshold, the fault occurrence is established in the system. In fault
isolation, a bank of neural networks, each corresponding to a par-
ticular gas turbine fault, must be trained to act as an identiÔ¨Åer of
faulty operating conditions. Similar to the fault detection module,
these networks can be used in fault isolation through residual gen-
eration. Note that in the FI module, the residuals far from zero cor-
respond to the healthy condition or to a fault that is not accounted
for in the ANN scheme and those close to zero that cross the
thresholds are associated with the faulty condition.

The ability to cope with measurement uncertainties and rapid
computational speed has driven a wide range of techniques, and
various neural network-based schemes have been developed for

[111] and Asgari et al.

fault detection and isolation of gas turbine engines. Although
feed-forward back-propagation single neural networks [108] and
a modular neural network [109] were successfully examined for
engine diagnostic purposes, the concept of generating multiple
neural networks for engine diagnostics was Ô¨Årst introduced in
[110]. Fast et al.
[112] developed
ANN-based system identiÔ¨Åcation models that predict the parame-
ters of gas turbines in various conditions and are particularly
useful in engine performance health assessment, especially if the
real data are only available over a limited operational range. To
perform combined mechanical and performance health monitor-
ing, Barad et al. [20] developed a feed-forward multilayered neural
network (MNN) with two hidden layers using the popular back-
propagation (BP) gradient descent algorithm for network training.
The obtained result proves that the ANN-based performance
health-monitoring tool is sufÔ¨Åciently robust and delivers an early
warning compared with the mechanical parameters. Dynamic neu-
ral networks have also been applied to achieve fault detection and
isolation of turbine engines. The dynamic ANN-based models pro-
posed in Refs. [105,106] demonstrate that the problem of dual
spool engine fault detection and isolation can be addressed quite
effectively using a bank of dynamic neural networks. More
recently, Loboda [113] compared the probabilistic neural network
(PNN) with Parzen window (PW) and k-nearest neighbor (K-NN)
methods for gas turbine fault classiÔ¨Åcation using probability den-
sity estimation.

Expert systems (ES) apply expert domain knowledge in a com-
puter program to create reasoning for problem solving through an
automated inference engine. The ES approach can be adjusted for

M. Tahan et al. / Applied Energy 198 (2017) 122‚Äì144

133

equipment data interpretation and condition monitoring due to its
ability to determine systematic reasoning procedures. This
knowledge-based approach is based on evaluation of on-line mon-
itored data using a set of rules learned from past experiences. Liao
[114] presented a complete literature review and classiÔ¨Åcation of
expert systems. Selected examples of ES use to support gas turbine
engine maintenance and diagnostics that highlight its interactivity
and user-friendly interfaces are discussed in Spina et al. [115].

The main reasoning methods implemented in ES for machine
diagnostic applications are rule-based reasoning, case-based rea-
soning, and model-based reasoning. A particular expert system
that has been used recently for gas turbine diagnosis is TIGER
[116]. Although the core of TIGER is a temporal rule-based system,
it also uses model-based reasoning for monitoring and diagnostics.
In another effort, case-based reasoning (CBR) was applied by GE for
engine fault detection at their monitoring and diagnostics center in
Atlanta [117]. The modular ‚Äò‚Äòplug and play‚Äù structure of the CBR
system facilitates experimentation and optimization, and in
2004, this system was integrated into the production environment.
In contrast to the ES, which uses hard-and-fast if-then rules, as
explained by Ross [118], fuzzy logic (FL) can be developed based on
unclear/uncertain if-then rules. FL supplies an interface that aids
experts in translating their qualitative knowledge to solve a prob-
lem. The related variables take on fuzzy values that are character-
ized by a membership function and a sentence. The linguistic
variable concept could be interpreted as an elastic constraint on
its value [119]. These constraints are spread by fuzzy inference
operations. The resulting reasoning procedure has robust interpo-
lation characteristics, which give fuzzy logic a signiÔ¨Åcant potency
with respect to the changes in factors such as system parameters
and disturbances. The general architecture of an FL-based
approach for the purpose of fault isolation is shown in Fig. 10.

Mohammadi and Montazeri-Gh [120], presented a perfect
description of the rule and database generation process aimed at
the development of an FL-based engine fault isolation model for
a Siemens SGT600 gas turbine engine, a 25.4 MW two-shaft engine
with free power turbine. The proposed model is a zero-order
Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type with 6 inputs and 6 outputs. The
inputs consist of a load applied to the power turbine and deviations
of certain measurements, including fuel Ô¨Çow rate, gas generator

speed, exhaust temperature, compressor outlet pressure and com-
pressor outlet temperature. The outputs consist of deviation of
compressor, gas generator turbine and power turbine efÔ¨Åciency
and Ô¨Çowrate, For rule-based generation, the input/output data
pairs obtained using the engine performance simulator are replied
via the table look-up technique [121].

Several gas turbine diagnostic models have been tested and suc-
cessfully applied based on FL theory. In 2001, Applebaum [122]
applied the fuzzy diagnostic strategy in the development of total
health usage and monitoring systems (THUMS) for proÔ¨Åtable
safety monitoring of gas turbine engines. This work used a fuzzy
expert classiÔ¨Åer to identify the fault and diagnose the residual
trend. Gayme et al. [123] developed an FL rule-based model using
heuristics measurements of the gas turbine and designed experi-
ments. The results showed the notable possibility of reaching a
credible prediction horizon for fault detection and isolation, even
with poor-quality data that included too many gaps. Ganguli
[124] applied the FL technique for engine module fault diagnosis
and demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy of 95%. The result
from Ogaji et al. [125] proved that the FL approach preserves the
non-linearity of the problem and can also cope with multiple
gas-path fault isolation problems that occur if more than one single
engine component deteriorate simultaneously. Demirci et al. [119]
established an automated gas turbine health monitoring system
(AEHMS) by implementing fuzzy logic that relied on the expert
knowledge and online data, and the entire engine operation was
simulated through Matlab and the corresponding fuzzy logic
toolbox. Zhao and Liu [126] conducted an engine fault diagnostic
approach that used a fuzzy logic matrix between the fault
symptoms and causations and also considered the principle of
maximum membership degree. The results proved that the pro-
posed fuzzy mathematical method produces reliable fault estima-
tion accuracy in gas turbine engines for cases of normal and
complex relationships between the fault causes and the symptoms.

acknowledged that practical and efÔ¨Åcient implementation of gas
turbine FDI can be achieved using an appropriate combination of
different approaches in a hybrid structure.

Borguet and L√©onard [127] used Kalman Ô¨Ålter technique, which
gives a proper estimation of the health condition for long-time-
scale deterioration, together with a secondary adaptive component
that searches out sudden changes in performance condition using
residual analysis. This auxiliary component implements a general-
ized likelihood ratio test to detect and estimate abrupt faults and
promote model responses to rapid deterioration.

In 2001, Kobayashi et al. [128] investigated a gas turbine diag-
nostic method using both neural networks and genetic algorithms.
In this research, ANN is applied to estimate the engine internal
health, and GA is applied to detect sensor bias in measurement
uncertainty. In a similar work presented by Sampath and Singh
[103], the nested neural network functions were used as a pre-
processor or Ô¨Ålter to reduce the number of fault classes that are
subsequently explored by the GA-based engine diagnostics model.
The results showed improvement in the accuracy, reliability, and
consistency of the diagnosis.

A method that applies the fuzzy self-organizing neural network
to gas turbine engine fault diagnosis was developed by Jiang et al.
[129]. In this method, the relationship between the fault cause and
fault symptoms is established according to fuzzy mathematics.
Two-dimensional mapped pictures of the sample fault are set, and
the actual faults are obtained via a self-organizing neural network.
A diagnostic method consisting of a Bayesian belief network
(BBN) and Kalman Ô¨Ålters was presented in [93] for gas turbine
health monitoring. In this proposed approach, a soft-constrained
Kalman Ô¨Ålter uses a priori information through implementation
of the BBN at each time step to estimate the unknown performance
parameters. This innovative method improved fault isolation capa-
bility compared with the stand-alone Kalman Ô¨Ålter.

Verma et al. [130] developed a genetic fuzzy system (GFS) to
perform fault isolation from noisy measurements of a gas turbine
engine. The proposed model uses GA to decrease the human effort
required in fuzzy systems for a trial and error process and makes
the development of diagnostic system easier and faster. This inven-
tive model allows rapid development of rule-based if-then fault
signatures for different engines. In another study, Xu et al. [131]
developed a novel diagnostic method that integrates the wavelet
transform and neural networks to resolve the issue of local minima
in optimization. In this model, the wavelet basis function assigned
to every neuron of the hidden layer is determined by learning. To
overcome the lack of samples in gas turbine diagnosis, an inte-
grated method using fuzzy and support vector machines was pro-
posed by Xia et al. [132]. Wang et al. [133] demonstrated a three-
step evaluation model for engine health monitoring of gas tur-
bines. The developed model integrates the fuzzy analytic hierarchy
process (fuzzy AHP), fuzzy preference programming (FPP) and a
technique for ordering the performance by similarity to the ideal
solution known as TOPSIS. The fuzzy AHP and FPP methods are
used to specify the relative weights of multiple evaluation criteria
and synthesize the ratings of the engine, and TOPSIS is subse-
quently applied to make a Ô¨Ånal decision on the overall perfor-
mance of each alternative.

The neuro-fuzzy architecture represents an integration of fuzzy
logic and neural network algorithms that use the learning abilities
of neural networks with the human knowledge representation
abilities of fuzzy systems. The neuro-fuzzy approach has been suc-
cessfully applied for
[134].
Recently, this method was used as an enhanced tool for fault diag-
nostics in gas turbine engines [135]. In 2005, Bettocchi et al. [136]
proposed a neuro-fuzzy system for gas turbine diagnostics. In this
research, the data generated by cycle programming were used to
set up ANNs. The most appropriate neuro-fuzzy system structure

rotating machinery diagnostics

for gas turbine diagnostics is selected with respect to computa-
tional time and robustness toward measurement uncertainty.
Recently, Abbasi et al. [137] used a bank of time-delay multilayer
perceptron (MLP) models to perform residual generation and sub-
sequently applied a local
linear neuro-fuzzy (LLNF) model to
achieve threshold adaptation in the fault detection step.

The authors believe that hybrid methods have a bright future
ahead in applications with innovative integration of different
methods that are able to resolve each other‚Äôs imperfections.

Table 4 presents the features, similarities, differences, advan-
tages and limitations of
the most applied approaches for
performance-based fault diagnosis of gas turbine engines, as high-
lighted in the literature [16,79].

Currently, the discussed engine monitoring methods have been
applied to different engine platforms, with different levels of com-
plexity, addressing different problems, and using different metrics
for evaluating performance. As such it is difÔ¨Åcult to perform a one-
to-one comparison between the accuracy of the candidate engine
monitoring techniques. In a valuable effort and in order to address
this shortcoming, NASA Glen Research Center provides a simulation
platform called Propulsion Diagnostic Method Evaluation Strategy
(ProDiMES) which is publicly available for research on the engine
health management [138]. The overall goal was to provide an envi-
ronment to facilitate the development and comparison of EHM
methods against a standard and credible benchmark. Several
research efforts have used this platform to compare various engine
diagnostic and prognostic methods. For example, Simon et al.
[139] presented a comparison between four diagnostic methods
that were applied to the Pro-DiMES blind-test-case data set. The
compared approaches includes Weighted Least Squares Single Fault
Isolation developed by NASA Glenn, Neural Network Single Fault
Isolation again developed by NASA Glenn, Kalman-Ô¨Ålter based
method developed by the University of Lie‚Äòge, and a Generalized
Observer/Estimator developed by Wright State University and the
accuracy of fault detection and isolation are extensively discussed.

6. Fault identiÔ¨Åcation

This section presents an overview of the deÔ¨Ånition, roots, and
symptoms of gas path faults in gas turbine engines for the purpose
of fault identiÔ¨Åcation. Typically, any fault in a single component or
inconsistency in the performance of a group of components can
increase machine degradation [140]. Generally, all possible faults
of the gas turbine can be classiÔ¨Åed into four categories, as illus-
trated in Fig. 11.

Fouling, erosion, corrosion, hot section problems, object damage,
clearance increase and leakage are the most common causes of gas
path deterioration [141]. It should be noted that the common faults
in aircraft engines and industrial engines are different to a certain
extent [142]. Aircraft engines operate without an inlet air Ô¨Åltration
system, and consequently, erosion is one of the key contributors to
degradation, especially in the compressor section. Industrial engines
use an appropriate air Ô¨Åltration system and are subject to fouling
caused by smaller particles. The exception might be engines sub-
jected to water injection in the compressor inlet [143], where an
incorrectly sized system can generate water droplets that are sufÔ¨Å-
ciently large to cause blade erosion. However, the effect of a partic-
ular fault on the performance of gas turbine is similar, regardless of
whether the engine is used in aircraft or industrial applications.

nes and have an inÔ¨Çuence on their performance are discussed in

6.1.1. Fouling

Fouling is the build-up of air impurities on the compressor
blade surface. This phenomenon can result in changes in the blade
inlet-angles, airfoil shape and surface roughness, as discussed by
Song et al. [144]. Diakunchak [145] states that fouling is the most
common cause of compressor deterioration and is known as the
source of approximately 70‚Äì85% of performance degradation in
gas turbine engines. However, fouling is a recoverable deteriora-
tion and can be reduced or even eliminated by cleaning to restore
the gas turbine engine Ô¨Çow path surfaces to near initial conditions.
Manual cleaning [146], grit-blasting [147], and ofÔ¨Çine and online
washing [148‚Äì150] methods are various methods that have been
proposed to prevent the unfavorable effects of compressor fouling.
Many research studies have examined the effect of fouling on char-
acteristic maps of an axial compressor in gas turbines. In one of the
recent valuable studies, Yang and Xu [151] used the combination of
a linear progression scaling method with the traditional stage
stacking technique to investigate the effect of fouling on the per-
formance map of axial Ô¨Çow compressors.

Meher-Homji [152] presented the causes and effects of hot sec-
tion fouling on gas turbine engines. According to this study, when
hot combustion products pass through Ô¨Årst stage nozzle, due to the
static temperature drop, some of them may deposit on the blades.
Since the throat area of the nozzle controls the compressor-turbine
matching, a reduction in this area leads to a move away from the
design match point. In addition, deposits may also accumulate on
the rotating blades. Contaminants that lead to turbine fouling
can enter the gas turbine by inlet air, liquid fuel, fuel additives
and NOx control injection Ô¨Çuid. Meher-Homji [153] pointed out
that since the fuel mass Ô¨Çow rate is typically less than 2% of the
air mass Ô¨Çow rate, 1 ppm sodium (Na, as major foulants) entering
by fuel would have the same effect as just 20 ppb airborne salt
entering the airÔ¨Çow. This is the main reason that most instructions
advise less than 0.5 ppm of Na.

6.1.2. Erosion

Material removal from the Ô¨Çow path components via abrasive
hard particles such as sand and Ô¨Çy ash is known as erosion. Balan
and Tabakoff [154] describe how erosion causes performance
losses due to the decrease in surface roughness, an increase in
blade tip clearance, blunting of the blade leading edge, thinning
of the trailing edge and shortening of the blade chord. Hamed,
Tabakoff et al. [155] listed the main parameters that have an inÔ¨Çu-

ence on gas turbine erosion, including ingested particle character-
istics, gas Ô¨Çow path and blade geometry, operating condition, and
blade material. Particle size has a great inÔ¨Çuence on the blade
impact patterns because larger particles affect the rotor and vane
blades and smaller particles tend to follow the Ô¨Çow path [156].
In the turbine section, damage due to erosive particles that enter
with the fuel is particularly severe, especially if blockage of the
cooling holes occurs. An excessive increase in the blade tempera-
ture and creep rupture are the main consequences of this phe-
nomenon. Because the Ô¨Åltration system used in industrial
applications can probably remove the bulk of the bigger particles,
erosion is more typically a problem in aero-derivative gas turbines
[157].

6.1.3. Corrosion

Corrosion is the loss or deterioration of material from the Ô¨Çow
path component caused by chemical reactions between the com-
ponent and certain contaminants that enter the gas turbine with
the inlet air, fuel, water or steam [158]. Both compressor and tur-
bine components are exposed to aggressively corrosive conditions,
and hence, this deterioration is often divided into three forms,
including compressor section corrosion, hot section corrosion,
and standby corrosion

Acceleration of air in compressor inlet guide vanes causes water
vapor to be condensed. In this condition, salt particles get dissolved
and may enter to the compressor. The water evaporates as it moves
through the compressor and, at times, salt is found deposited on
the compressor blades. Experience has shown that the deposits
often contain sodium and potassium chlorides. Salty environment
leads to pitting corrosion of the blades. This kind of corrosion only
happens in compressor section and according to Haskell [159] is
rarely experienced after the eighth stage of the compressor as no
moisture will survive at a high temperature of this location. Similar
to erosion and fouling, corrosion can be controlled with good Ô¨Åltra-
tion; however, the right conditions of fog, humidity, or rain can
cause migration of the salt through the inlet Ô¨Ålter. A much more
common attack is caused by offensive atmospheric condition
whereas engine operates in marine environments and heavy
industrial areas located near chemical plants or industrial cement
factories [160].

For a given gas turbine, the speciÔ¨Åc work of the ideal engine
cycle depends on the maximum to minimum temperature ratio.
Temperature increase results to increased high-temperature oxida-

M. Tahan et al. / Applied Energy 198 (2017) 122‚Äì144

137

tion, hot corrosion, and sulphidation. In this condition, poor selec-
tion of material and coating may lead to catastrophic failure. High-
temperature oxidation is the chemical reaction between compo-
nents surface metal atoms and oxygen from surrounding hot gas-
eous environment [161]. It results in the formation of an external
oxide scale that may be protective. However, oxide scales can crack
or spall from the substrate surface due to thermally induced stres-
ses when subjected to vibration and start/stop thermal cycles
[162]. This phenomenon may also occur on the inner surface of
blade cooling passage and result in blade failure. Hot oxidation
starts at 810¬∞K but accelerates at higher temperature [153].

Corrosion on engines that are not used for long extended peri-
ods is an issue that needs to be addressed by preservation methods
[158]. Meher-Homji and Gabriles [163] remarks this kind of corro-
sion is the result of air moisture and corrosive particles presence in
the machine and normally happens during an engine shutdown. In
the case that corrosion products accumulate in the blade attach-
ment areas, because of clearance increase, crevice corrosion may
take place. In another case, the presence of corrosive material pos-
sibly from airborne salt
frequently cause corrosion pits on
uncoated airfoils, which has the risk of cracking. Standby corrosion
reduces the blade fatigue strength signiÔ¨Åcantly which demon-
strates symptoms of stress corrosion fatigue as discussed by Sohre
[164].

6.1.4. Object damage

When an object enters the gas path of a turbine engine, there is
a high probability that it will impact rotating or stationary compo-
nents before being exhausted. This is true for both foreign objects
such as stones, hardware, pavement fragments, and birds ingested
at the intake with the working Ô¨Çow, which causes foreign object
damage (FOD), and domestic objects such as nuts, bolts and pieces
of an airfoil liberated within the engine itself, which leads to
domestic object damage (DOD) [165]. This damage takes the form
of sharp V-notches in the leading edge of blades, especially in the
early compressor stages, where these foreign substances impact,
as discussed by Nowell, Dini et al. [166]. Notches dimension vary
from few micrometers to tens of millimeters, based on the blade
construction, particle size, nature of the foreign object and the
intensity of impact [167]. Object damage is not a serious problem
in industrial gas turbine compared with aircraft. The ease with
which object damage can be detected is a strong function of its
extent. In some cases, a step change in vibration may be noticeable,
in others, a drop in performance may be signiÔ¨Åcant [145].

6.1.5. Tip clearance increase (blade rubbing)

Due to the differential pressure across the compressor blades,
leakage Ô¨Çow from the pressure surface to the suction surface
through the tip clearance area is common. The effect of this leakage
on the pressure rise, efÔ¨Åciency drop, and operational stability can-
not be neglected [168]. An extensive investigation of axial com-
pressor
tip clearance Ô¨Çow and the relevant active control

methods was presented by Bae et al. [169]. Kempe et al. [170] pro-
posed an all-Ô¨Åber, self-calibrating, economical probe capable of
near-real-time, single-port, simultaneous blade-to-blade tip clear-
ance measurements with sub-millimeter accuracy in the Ô¨Årst
stages of a gas turbine. To improve the gas turbine performance,
Fabian et al. [171] investigated a control system used to maintain
a constant blade tip clearance throughout the entire engine
operation.

6.1.6. Thermal distortion

In the combustion chamber exit, changes in the radial and cir-
cumferential temperature traverse pattern could lead to temporary
or permanent deformation [172]. This problem, which could occur
due to faults in the fuel nozzle sprays and wrapped combustion
chamber components, results in Ô¨Årst-stage turbine blades that
are untwisted, bowed, burnt or wrapped [173].

ClassiÔ¨Åcation of performance-related faults based on their loca-
tion and whether they are recoverable or not is shown in Table 5.

6.2. Gas path fault quantiÔ¨Åcation

To perform fault identiÔ¨Åcation or to create a foundation for sim-
ulating faults in a computer program, the relationship between
physical faults and component deterioration must be determined.
Table 6 presents a brief summary of research that has been per-
formed to quantify this relationship.

Based on the review presented in Table 6 and many other refer-
ences, including [35,172], Zwebek et al. [184] summarized the
effect of various physical faults on component health parameter
degradation, as listed in Table 7.

In the fault identiÔ¨Åcation process, it is useful to Ô¨Ånd a relation-
ship between the faults and their corresponding effects on the
engine performance. In this regard, Zwebek et al. [184] provided
a representation of component degradation used to simulate the
effect of implanted faults on gas turbine performance. In another
valuable effort, [185] investigated the effect of different kinds of
faults on the engine compressor characteristics and discuss the
way of faults modeling in more detail; where the stage character-
istics modiÔ¨Åcation factors are formed by considering severity and
distribution of the fault.

The effects of main gas path component degradation on gas tur-
bine performance are reported in several research studies. Zwebek
and Pilidis [184] investigated changes in gas turbine efÔ¨Åciency,
power output, exhaust temperature, and exhaust mass Ô¨Çow by
implanting component faults into an engine performance model
developed by TURBOMACH, which is the gas turbine performance
code of CranÔ¨Åeld University. The obtained results show that degra-
dation in the turbine‚Äôs isentropic efÔ¨Åciency has the greatest nega-
tive impact on engine power and thermal efÔ¨Åciency. The study also
reports that the effect of component isentropic efÔ¨Åciency on
exhaust Ô¨Çow capacity is negligible, and this parameter is primarily
affected by Ô¨Çow capacity changes due to faults such as fouling and

mechanisms that cause engine degradation, namely, changes in
blade surfaces due to erosion and fouling and changes in clear-
ances. Yoon et al. [187] evaluated operation of a micro-gas turbine
by implanting deterioration of various components, including the
compressor, turbine and recuperate, by changing the component
characteristics. The study trained a neural network using the gen-
erated deterioration data for the purpose of fault detection and iso-
lation. Kurz et al. [188] performed a study to investigate the effect
of deterioration of a given component on measurable engine per-
formance factors that are often used in condition monitoring,
including compressor discharge pressure, gas generator speed, Ô¨År-
ing temperature, and air Ô¨Çow. In another report, the same authors,
Kurz et al. [142] discussed the degradation mechanism and the
impact of component degradation on the performance of two-
shaft gas turbine engines because they are used as the compressor
drivers for natural gas service. The article highlights that the same

level of component degradation might exhibit different relative
performance reductions in various ambient conditions.

7. Fault prognostics

Until approximately a decade ago,

the focus of engine
performance-based health monitoring technologies has been on
diagnosis of critical faults. Moving towards an improved insight
into engine health, the gas turbine research community has
recently decided to incorporate time evolution into monitoring
systems by adding prognostic capabilities. As discussed by Heng
et al. [189], prognostics are different from traditional reliability-
based methods that rely on event record distributions of identical
units to estimate characteristics such as the mean-time-to-failure
and probability of reliable operation.
In fact, the prognostic
approach aims to predict the ongoing degradation of the machine
or its components currently under operation. Generally speaking,
prognostics are based on the outputs of diagnostics, and therefore,
the accuracy is dependent on the diagnosis accuracy. As shown in
Fig. 12, the degradation of an engine can be detected and isolated
using diagnostics, and the history of the engine or its component
degradation can be fed into the prognostic model.

In addition, it should be emphasized that the prognostics accu-
racy is directly dependent to the employed methods, where gener-
ally they can be divided into two main categories: model-based
methods and data-driven models. The model-based prognosis
attempts to incorporate a model of the engine into the estimation
of degradation and the data-driven approaches commonly use
historically recorded data to produce prediction outputs.
In
model-based methods prognostic accuracy is directly coupled to
prognostic process. In these methods, the frequency of prognostics
should be similar to that of engine model adaptation. This will
ensure that the progressive evolution of the engine‚Äôs health signa-

ture is well reÔ¨Çected in the engine model and accurately captured
through the diagnostics. For data-based methods a critical element
of the prognostic process is the quality of data and the complexity
of the employed method. Extensive and progressive training of
Neural Networks, multiple runs of Genetic Algorithms and retun-
ing data-based algorithms should be performed every time that
the operating conditions of the engine are outside the operating
envelope initially used for validating the subject methods.

Prognostics can be classiÔ¨Åed based on several features, includ-
ing the selected health parameter, time frame, type of degradation,
and forecasting approaches.
 A short-term investigation that predicts the future health of the
system over a limited time horizon or a long-term investigation
that can also forecast the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) or
estimate the probability of reliable operation.
 Dependent parameter-based prognostics, which rely on predic-
tion of engine measurements, are related to the global health of
the engine, such as gas temperature and shaft speeds, or inde-
pendent parameter-based prognostics, which rely on prediction
of health parameters such as component efÔ¨Åciency and Ô¨Çow
capacity.
 Prediction of the gradual performance deterioration that typi-
cally occurs due to a fault such as fouling and erosion or predic-
tion of
instantaneous
deterioration due to an event such as foreign object damage.
Although the former can be investigated using a forecasting
algorithm, the latter can be considered using hazard plots
[191]. The focus of this section of the current review article is
on gradual deterioration, but one should note that when a sud-
den fault is detected and isolated, its effect should be consid-
ered (Fig. 12).

that manifest as

sudden faults

Most of the published articles for gas turbine condition moni-
toring concentrate on fault diagnostics or fault prognostics exclu-
sively. However, as explained in Section 7, prognostics are based
on the outputs of diagnostics. Hence, if a paper has investigated
both issues, it has Ô¨Årst discussed the diagnostic and then per-
formed prognostics. Since the concept and approaches in diagnos-
tics and prognostics are different, they can be discussed separately.
Therefore the following sub-sections discuss the methods and
approaches of prognostics.

7.1. Model-based methods

Gas turbine model-based engine prognostic techniques are
mainly developed using Kalman Ô¨Ålters or various other tracking Ô¨Ål-

ters. As mentioned previously in the diagnostic section, the Kalman
Ô¨Ålter algorithm takes the current health state and available sensor
measurements and generates a virtual sensor that can predict opti-
mal estimates of engine health parameters. Simon and Simon [192]
has successfully developed a Kalman Ô¨Ålter-based model that incor-
porates linear state inequality constraints for turbofan engine
health estimation. Particle Ô¨Åltering by the ability to include system
parameters in the state vector for the purpose of system health
tracking represents a good solution to failure prognosis problems.
Daroogheh et al. [193] developed a Ô¨Åxed-lag dynamic linear model
with an adaptive length moving window for time series forecasting
using a time-varying ARMA model with Ô¨Åxed and variable model
orders. The proposed method is applied for prognosis of gas tur-
bine engine health parameters for the next 60 steps ahead. The
obtained results show that even though the mass Ô¨Çow capacity
of the turbine is not a good feature for use in prognosis analysis,
the failure time can be identiÔ¨Åed with acceptable accuracy for up
to 50 steps ahead by tracking the drops in compressor and turbine
efÔ¨Åciency.

7.2. Data-driven methods

Data-driven models rely only on previously observed data to
predict the projection of a system state or to match similar pat-
terns in the history to infer RUL. Because sensors are sources of
considerable noise, a pre-processor smoothing algorithm can be
applied to extract information from historically acquired data.
Marinai [191] states that the three most common pre-processor
techniques are simple moving average (MA), weighted MA and
exponential smoothing. Data-driven models can generally be cate-
gorized as statistical models and artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence models.

Evolutionary/statistical models such as time-series regression,
autoregressive moving average (ARMA), and hidden Markov model
(HMM) have been extensively applied to engine prognostics prob-
lems. Li and Nilkitsaranont [190] applied linear and quadratic
regression techniques to the scattered deviation in health parame-
ters, including compressor Ô¨Çow and isentropic efÔ¨Åciency, for prog-
nosis purposes. In this work, given that a constant failure rate that
starts at the beginning of an operation is followed by an increasing
failure rate, a linear regression model is Ô¨Årst applied, and quadratic
regression is applied for the time at which a change in failure trend
is observed. Recently, Tsoutsanis et al. [43] developed a regression-
based method to accurately capture the component degradation
pattern for an engine in dynamic conditions. To this end, Ô¨Årst, a
nonlinear unconstrained optimization method was applied to
reconstruct the component characteristic curves to match the
resulting simulated measurements with those of the reference

140

engine for each diagnostic window. Second, the developed model
was used to diagnose the engine health degradation in sliding
windows. Finally, the future degradation trend was accurately
captured by local Ô¨Åtting of the linear regression functions at the
sliding windows. The accuracy of the proposed prognosis scheme
was evaluated using the probability density function (PDF) and
RUL metrics. The results show promising prospects for the pro-
posed methodology for accurately estimating and predicting mul-
tiple component degradations over time. An alternative approach
has been recently proposed by Tsoutsanis and Meskin [194] where
the acceleration of degradation of an engine component forms the
criterion by which the aforementioned windows are activated in
order to satisfy a linear propagation assumption for every local
window. In another research effort, Marinai [191] presented a
method using an ARMA model to forecast the failure risk of a Trent
800 engine for a short-term-ahead time horizon. The results of this
study show that ARMA has a remarkable capability for discovering
trends and predicting the turning points in the short-term analysis.
The accuracy of this method in short-term forecasting is affected
by the ability of the analyst. Giantomassi et al. [195] estimated
the RUL of turbo-fan engines using the hidden Markov model.
The results show that the adopted approach is especially suitable
for situations in which a large amount of data is available off-
line. Lipowsky et al. [196] presented a novel detection technique
based on Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear models (DLMs).
Bayesian forecasting enables the calculation of conditional proba-
bilities, whereas DLMs are mathematical tools used in time series
analysis. The combination of the two methods can be used to cal-
culate the probability density functions prior to the next observa-
tion or the so-called forecast distributions. The drawbacks of this
approach are that several crucial parameters must be determined
heuristically, which might lead to uninformative distributions,
and once the fault is detected, a ‚Äò‚Äòrule of thumb‚Äô‚Äô is involved in
determining the gradient change in the prognostic trajectory,
which might not be sufÔ¨Åciently accurate. To overcome this prob-
lem, Zaidan et al. [197] established a Bayesian hierarchical model
to perform inference and inform a probabilistic model of the
remaining useful life. The techniques use Bayesian methods to
combine two sources of information: historical in-service data
across the engine Ô¨Çeet and a once per-Ô¨Çight transmitted perfor-
mance measurement from the engine(s) under prognosis. The
model is improved by applying variational inference to the hierar-
chical formulation in order to overcome the computational and
convergence concerns that are raised by the numerical sampling
techniques needed for inference in the original
formulation

[198]. The proposed technique offered predictive results within
well-deÔ¨Åned uncertainty bounds and demonstrated several advan-
tages of the hierarchical variant‚Äôs ability to integrate multiple unit
data and address realistic prognostic challenges. Puggina and Ven-
turini [13] suggested an approach based on the Monte Carlo prob-
ability distribution to predict the future health status of an engine.
The major feature of this technique is that the prognosis can be
implemented for both local and global performance parameters,
such as fuel Ô¨Çow rate or local temperatures, to estimate the sys-
tem‚Äôs future availability.

ArtiÔ¨Åcial intelligence methods such as neural networks are also
used by many researchers for the purpose of gas turbine prognostics.
Ke-Xu et al. [199] applied a particle swarm optimized neural net-
work to perform a time series prediction of health parameters.
Vatani et al. [200] proposed two artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence methodolo-
gies for degradation prognosis of gas turbine engines. The Ô¨Årst prog-
nostic scheme was based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) that
enables learning related to the engine degradation from the avail-
able measurable data, and the second scheme was based on a nonlin-
ear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural network
architecture. It was shown that the NARX network can be trained
with fewer data points and that the prediction errors are lower than
those of the RNN architecture. In another study, Daroogheh et al.
[201] developed a hybrid model to construct observation proÔ¨Åles
for future time horizons. In their proposed model, the particle Ô¨Ålter-
ing approach is used as a model-based method to compute the
engine states and the health parameters, and as a computationally
intelligent technique, the artiÔ¨Åcial neural networks approach is used
to forecast the future health scheme of the engine using the obtained
observations. A model combining the attributes of neural networks
and expert systems was developed by DePold and Gass [202] for
trend change detection and prognosis of engines.

As discussed above, to develop and implement a suitable prog-
nostic approach for gas turbine engines depending on the critical-
ity of the monitored engine, various levels of data, historical
information, and models are required. Table 8 gives an overview
of the recommended information and models necessary for imple-
menting each of aforementioned prognostic models [203].

concerns for heavy-duty gas turbine equipment owners, and a
well-designed maintenance program that optimizes operational

Several authors have reported on a variety of subjects related to
gas turbine condition-based maintenance issues, such as health
assessment, diagnostics, and prognostics. Numerous research
efforts have emphasized the need for implementing health moni-
toring in gas turbine maintenance since it creates faster and more
reliable information for gas turbine users who reÔ¨Åne the mainte-
nance strategy accordingly. Therefore, the main objective of this
study was to review and summarize recent scholarly efforts which
are focused in the performance-based health monitoring, diagnos-
tics and prognostics of gas turbines. Non-performance-based mon-
itoring methods are brieÔ¨Çy described in this review article but not
examined thoroughly since they are beyond the main focus of this
study. Five areas in need of consideration and improvement are
primarily discussed: (1) performance degradation and gas path
analysis,
(3)
techniques for fault detection and isolation, (4) principles of fault
identiÔ¨Åcation, and (5) prognostic enhancement in health monitor-
ing. The numerous summarized frameworks, procedures, and tech-
niques along with the comprehensive research references
introduced in this article can provide a striking platform for
experts, students or novice researchers and decision-makers
working in the area of gas turbine engines to know the latest
releases and state of the art.

(2) performance

In recent years, studies have demonstrated that most research
in this area focuses on: (1) condition assessment with only few
available measurements, (2) performance prediction and diagnos-
tics in off-design steady and transient conditions, (3) real-time
monitoring, (4) multiple component fault diagnostics, and (5)
reduction of the negative effects of noise and sensor bias on condi-
tion monitoring. Given the plethora of papers in the Ô¨Åeld, this
review article aims to provide insights about where the current
research is heading and those issues that attract signiÔ¨Åcant
research and development in the short and long term. However,
in contrary to the existing reviews, this article aims to highlight
the recent trend for performing diagnostics and prognostics with
transient data where the condition monitoring systems should
capture the fast nonlinear dynamics of the engine at an increased
frequency in order to establish a good quality data set for diagnos-
tic and prognostic purposes.

for fault

An overview of the references shows that condition monitoring
has the potential to play an effective role in the future gas turbine
industry as these machines become larger and offshore turbines
become more popular. Although proof exists of rapid development
in the recent years, certain of the main challenges that must be
addressed by the gas turbine research community are summarized
as follows:
 Knowledge of the gas turbine deterioration mechanisms is
isolation and identiÔ¨Åcation. Additional
essential
research in this area can enhance the accuracy of diagnostic
models.
 Development of tools or methods to extract, process and inter-
pret knowledge, experience, and event data types of informa-
tion can enhance the monitoring capabilities.
 Development of more effective collection and accurate pre-
analysis methods for performance data could yield great
improvements in the development of gas turbine performance
health monitoring systems.
 Further investigation on development of hybrid diagnostic and
prognostic approaches could assist in generating robust tools
with fewer deÔ¨Åciencies and additional features.
 The degree of user-friendliness is a major criterion in the devel-
opment of maintenance strategies. This feature supports the
users, many of whom do not have a profound knowledge of
the performance of gas turbines or modeling algorithms.

141
 Finally, additional focus on the development of an integrated
sensing, data processing, diagnostic and prognostic system
intended to facilitate the application of condition monitoring
in real time for shipboard plant monitoring is required for the
next generation of intelligent maintenance systems for gas
turbines.
